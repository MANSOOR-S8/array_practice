    <h1>Guess a Number.</h1>
    <p>Guess the number between 1 and 10 and find the correct number.</p>


    <script>

        const ChooseNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 2;  //  Math.random() generates a decimal (floating-point) number between 0 and 1 (e.g., 0.23,) and we need whole number so "Math.floor" convert the decimal number to whole number.
        let GuessNumber = 0; // 0 is not in that range, so it ensures the first prompt always runs. If we set guess = 1, and the secret number is also 1, the game would end before the user even gets a chance to guess


        //agr "GuessNumber !== ChooseNumber" k tho ye program bar bar chalna chahiy. jab thak wo sahi number guess na kary.
        while (GuessNumber !== ChooseNumber) {
            GuessNumber = parseInt(prompt("Enter number between 1 and 10"));

            if (GuessNumber > ChooseNumber){
                alert("Try small number");

            } else if (GuessNumber < ChooseNumber){
                alert("Try greater number.");
